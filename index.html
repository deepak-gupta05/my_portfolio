        <h2 class="bio-title">About Me</h2>
        <p class="bio-text">
          Hello,I'm Deepak,an enthusiastic and motivated full stack web developer eager to kickstart my career in the world of web development. As a recent graduate in Computer Science, I have a solid foundation in programming and a passion for creating dynamic and user-friendly web applications.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>
    <section class="about-details">
      <h2>More About Me</h2>
      <p>
       On the front-end, I excel at utilizing <b>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</b> to build intuitive and responsive user interfaces. I have a keen eye for design and pay attention to the details that make a website visually appealing and engaging. I'm also proficient in front-end frameworks such as <b>React and NextJS</b>, allowing me to develop dynamic and interactive web experiences.
      </p>
      <p>My journey as a developer started several years ago when I discovered my love for coding and problem-solving. Since then, I have honed my skills in front-end and back-end development, allowing me to tackle projects from start to finish. I enjoy the versatility and challenges that come with being a full stack developer, as it enables me to work on various aspects of a project and continuously learn and grow.</p>
      <p>
        When it comes to the back-end, I'm skilled in various programming languages like <b>Python, Javascript, or Node.js</b>, depending on the project requirements. I have experience with server-side frameworks and technologies such as <b>Express.js, Django</b>. I can handle data storage and retrieval using databases like <b>MySQL, MongoDB</b>, ensuring optimal performance and scalability.
      </p>
       <p>
        I'm knowledgeable about <b>RESTful APIs</b> and have experience integrating third-party services and APIs into web applications. Security is always a priority, and I follow best practices to protect data and implement authentication and authorization mechanisms.
      </p>
      <p>Additionally, I have knowledge of version control systems like <b>Git</b>, which allows me to collaborate effectively with other developers and maintain clean and organized codebases. I am also familiar with cloud platforms like <b>AWS</b> and have deployed applications using services like <b>EC2, S3, VPC and Lambda.</b></p>
      <p>What sets me apart is my ability to understand and bridge the gap between different layers of development. I possess strong <b>analytical and problem-solving skills</b>, which enable me to identify issues quickly and implement efficient solutions. I am a strong believer in clean code practices, test-driven development, and continuous integration and deployment.</p>
      <p>Beyond technical skills, I value effective communication and teamwork. I believe in collaborating closely with clients, stakeholders, and fellow developers to ensure that the end product aligns with their vision and meets their expectations.</p>
      <p>In my free time, I enjoy exploring new technologies, reading tech blogs, and participating in online coding communities. I thrive on challenging projects that push my boundaries and allow me to expand my skill set.</p>
      <p>If you're looking for a dedicated and versatile full stack developer who can bring your ideas to life, I'd love to connect and discuss how I can contribute to your project or team. Feel free to reach out to me through dgupta278@gmail.com. I look forward to hearing from you!"</p>
